git assignment
steps followd:
Created a new repository in my github account and initialized it with this readme file
I cloned the repo into my local machine using 'git clone' command
I created a new file name hello.txt from command line and used nano to edit and add text 'hello Git' to it and save
i then staged all the changes using 'git add .'
Then done my initial commit using command 'git commit -m 'first-commit'
Then i used git push to push the changes alrady staged to my remote repository
I finally visited the repository's url in the browser and seen that the changes have been applied successfully.
